                    <p>I've made a lot of plugins using the spigot/bukkit API but a lot of them are private for obvious reasons, but that doesn't mean that i don't have any public projects to show off!</p>
                    <p>You can head into my <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/members/iuserod.1301142/" class="text-decoration-none">SpigotMC profile</a> and still visit some of my public projects</p>
                    <p><br>NOTE: i've removed almost 75% of my public projects from my spigot & github profile as i was not satisfied by the support they received, if you wanna see them, you can contact me & will talk about it!</p>

                    <p>I've made <strong>some</strong> discord bots in my career of python development because of the fact that i almost only use python as my backend programming language for obvious reasons.</p>
                    <p>Working for a lot of companies, took the time i had to atleast make some bots that i can show you guys, i'm really sorry for that.</p>
                    <p>At the moment i only have one bot i can show off as for the other bots, they are private.</p>
